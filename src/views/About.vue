        <h2>What is Brainfuck?</h2>
        <p>BrainF*ck is an Esoteric programming language made by Urban MÃ¼ller in 1993. 
            It is composed of 8 different instructions and was pruposely made to be hard to read and overcomplicated.</p>
        <h2>What is this website?</h2>
        <p>This website is a brainf*ck interpreter implementation written in typescript. 
            A hello world example is pre-loaded for you to try!</p>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>For the last couple of months, I have been looking into developing console emulators but,
             since I do not have the knowledge to build one at the present moment, I decided to learn the principles behind building an interpreter whilst learning typescript.</p>
        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>On the internet, you will usually find me by the name "Liberontissauri", I have been studying software development for the last two years. As of lately, I have been 
            working mainly with javascript, html and css, but I used to write the majority of my code in python.
